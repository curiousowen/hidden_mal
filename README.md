# hidden_mal
A tool for advanced string extraction and decoding from binary files to aid malware analysis.
This tool is designed to assist malware analysts in extracting and decoding strings from binary files. It extends basic string extraction with additional features, including stack string reconstruction, tight string detection, and multiple encoding detection (Base64, Hex, ROT13). This helps analysts gain insights into the functionality and behavior of potentially malicious binaries.

Features

    ASCII String Extraction: Extracts plain ASCII strings from binary data.
    Base64 Decoding: Detects and decodes Base64-encoded strings.
    Hex Decoding: Detects and decodes hex-encoded strings.
    ROT13 Decoding: Detects and decodes ROT13-encoded strings.
    Stack String Reconstruction: Identifies and reconstructs strings built on the stack.
    Tight String Detection: Finds tightly packed strings in the binary data.

Output

The script will output the extracted and decoded strings in the following categories:

    ASCII Strings
    Base64 Decoded Strings
    Hex Decoded Strings
    ROT13 Decoded Strings
    Stack Strings
    Tight Strings

Development

This tool is a starting point for developing more sophisticated malware analysis capabilities. Below are some suggested areas for further development:

    Enhanced String Decoding: Implement additional decoding algorithms for other encoding techniques commonly used by malware.
    Improved Stack String Detection: Refine heuristics for detecting and reconstructing stack strings, possibly by analyzing more instruction patterns.
    Binary Analysis Integration: Integrate with other binary analysis tools to provide a more comprehensive analysis pipeline.
    GUI Interface: Develop a graphical user interface to make the tool more accessible to users who are not comfortable with command-line interfaces.
    Automated Reporting: Generate detailed reports of the analysis, including context about where strings were found in the binary.
    Performance Optimization: Optimize the code for better performance, especially when analyzing large binaries.
